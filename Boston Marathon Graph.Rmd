## Graph of the winners of the Boston Marathon

For an assignment in one of my Stats classes I had to find a data set and summarize it in a graphic. I found a data set containing information on the winners of the Boston Marathon from Kaggle at the following link; <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zhikchen/boston-marathon-winners-men-and-women>.\
As a graphic for the data I chose a scatter-plot of the times of the winners over the years that the marathon has been held. I further indicated which data points are from the female marathon and which are from the male marathon by changing the shape of the points, and the continent that the winners are from by the colour of the points. This visualization shows the trend of the winning times for the marathon and the differences in speed between the Sexes.

```{r cars}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# R Packages that are used
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(countrycode)

# Importing the data
Mens_Boston_Marathon_Winners <- read_csv("Data/Mens_Boston_Marathon_Winners.csv")
Womens_Boston_Marathon_Winners <- read_csv("Data/Womens_Boston_Marathon_Winners.csv")

# Adding a column to indicate the sex of the winner
Mens_w_Sex <- data.frame(Mens_Boston_Marathon_Winners, 'm')
names(Mens_w_Sex)[names(Mens_w_Sex) == "X.m."] <- "Sex"

Womens_w_Sex <- data.frame(Womens_Boston_Marathon_Winners, 'f')
names(Womens_w_Sex)[names(Womens_w_Sex) == "X.f."] <- "Sex"

# Combining the two data frames
All_Winners <- rbind(Mens_w_Sex, Womens_w_Sex)
All_Winners <- na.omit(All_Winners)

# Assigning each contestants country to a continent.
All_Winners$Continent <- countrycode(sourcevar = All_Winners$Country, 
                                     origin = "country.name", 
                                     destination = "continent")
# Yugoslavia is causing problems here since it is not a country that currently 
# exists, it is the only NA, so we can manually replace it with Europe, which 
# is the continent Yugoslavia was from.
All_Winners$Continent <- replace(All_Winners$Continent, 
                                 is.na(All_Winners$Continent), 
                                 "Europe")

# Plotting the data
ggplot(data = All_Winners,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Time, color = Continent, shape = Sex)) +
  geom_point(
             alpha = 0.9,
             size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1895, 2025, 10),
                     minor_breaks = c()) +
  scale_y_time(breaks = hms::as_hms(c(7200, 8400, 9600, 10800, 12000, 13200))) + 
  labs(title = "Time of the Winners of the Boston Marathon by Year and Sex")
